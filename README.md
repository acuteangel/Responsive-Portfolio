# Responsive-Portfolio
The first main consideration for making my webpage responsive was to reformat my header at each break point. Because I used grid positioning for my header, I had to change the width of the empty columns to properly space the rest of the header.

Besides this, most of the changes made at each breakpoint was to change the sizes of the different containers, images, and boxes of text. 

At the 640px breakpoint, I had to change the layout for my header, my biography, and my gallery. For my header and gallery, which were both on a grid system, I had to lower the amount of columns used and increase the number of rows in order to fit everything. For my biography I removed the float property from my images so they would fit neatly above and below the text, and so the text wouldn't get squished between the images and margins.
